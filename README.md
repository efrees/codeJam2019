Code from the competition and practice in 2019

This is first an archive of what I did, so you'll see incorrect solutions. In particular, both problems submitted for Round 1A failed on the hidden cases due to insufficient analysis, and the third wasn't completed in time.

I'm planning to update with fixes for some of the solutions, and potentially solutions from other rounds, for practice.

No secrets here, other than an insider view into my somewhat jumbled thought process during competition. You may use or learn from this code at your own risk.
